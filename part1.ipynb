    "\n",
    "This model and study can help our company to better predict the number of subscription per day. And with the prediction, we can decide when to launch certain marketing campaigns in order to promote more sales; and also better estimate the sales impact if something went wrong in the upper stream (e.g. reg process, upload process) and how to remediate. My assumption is that seasonality(this weekday last year), pacing of the previous month, and number of registration and number of uploaders are going to have impact on the target value. Also, understanding how each feature might perform differently in different region.  "
